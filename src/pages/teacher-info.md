## Teaching

Main point is that we want people to feel safe and have fun. Keep focus on that people have enough skill to be in your workshop. You don't have to check the prequisites, but you can ask the attendees to leave if they are not skilled enough.

We'll check the level of the group after the first workshop. Sometimes we have had to lower the levels of the workshops.

The levels are:

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td class="workshop-0 text-black">Beginner</td>
<td>In this level there should be no prerequisites. The attendees on this level may have very little or no experiense of the topic. Some attendees might not have any experience on acroyoga or partner acrobatics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="workshop-1 text-black">Intermediate</td>
<td>In this level there can be some prerequisites. You can expect the attendees to have some experience on the topic. Since there are multiple intermediate workshops available simultaneously, some of them can be easier and some harder. Here are some examples of possible prerequisites: sidestar (L-basing), two man high, lightly supported handstand on floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="workshop-2 text-black">Experienced</td>
<td>In this level you can expect the attendees to already have some experience on the topic and there can be harder prerequisites. Most skilled attendees can be expected to have solid hand to hand, BUT it would be good, if attendees with a little bit lower skills could join too. Here are some examples of possible prerequisites: solid standing foot to hand, L-based hand to hand for 10 sec.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="workshop-3 text-black">L-base</td>
<td>Open level for Acroyoga and L-Basing stuff. Might need to scale to fit the group. Can have some prerequisites.</td>
</tr>

## Warm up

The warm up period is included in the workshop. You can do a short warm up or do some acro games. The days first workshop should have a longer and gentler warm up.

Games should be something fun and not dangerous. We have bad experiences about tag games, so please avoid them.

## [Schedule](/timetable)

Our first two workshops are games and spotting. We'd like every teacher that is present to join these workshops and have one game and one spotting drill ready. At the same time we introduce the teachers to the participants.
